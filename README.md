# Climb Against Time by Stefan Cliff

 This is my bachelors thesis project!

 The main technology I'll be using is Unity (version 2022.3.3f1), but some assisting ones are:

## Why did I make this game and what is it about?

The game design is that of a 2D pixel-art platformer, with the focus of the story being about self exploration, perception as well general/familiar thoughts and questions one asks oneself:

        ~ Who?
        ~ What?
        ~ Where?
        ~ Why?
        ~ How?

It is these questions as well as the theory of perspective relativity/reality that inspired me to create this games atmosphere. They are the reason why I chose various shades of greys and blacks, to have most things obscured and let the players mind fill in the blanks on their own. 

        ~ "Time is relative",
        ~ "The world is what you make of it",
        ~ "You are your own worst enemy, your greatest friend, the one who can push you forward as well as hold you back",

These thoughts and philosophical questions are what inspired me when writing the actual story. The hidden messages as well as the actual meaning of the narrative I aimed to make and represent.

## The Game 

The controls and the approachability of this game are rather low level. Anyone who has played a single game before would be able to complete this game I feel, as the only thing the player has to manipulate is the character itself. There is no combat, no puzzles, no tricks. It is actually because of the very human experience and message I am trying to send that I made the control scheme so approachable, as I believe that everyone from every walk of life has had these questions roaming inside them. 

The Game starts with the player character awaking at the bottom of a tower without knowing where they are, who they are nor for how long they have been there. The only "drive" they feel is the need to climb up and out. That they believe that at the top they will find and have all the answers because it must be so.

Without spoiling too much of the actual story, very soon after beginning their climb a timer appears in the top corner of the screen that begins counting down. If the time runs out or the character takes too much fall damage then the screen fades to black and they re-awaken at the bottom of the tower again but this time, they aren't entirely alone...

Through skill and perseverance, do you think you can make it to the top in "time"?
